    <img src="#">

    <p>I'm was born in Fullerton, Ca. My family moved to Satesville, NC when I was five. I love history and consider myself a WWII expert.
    The beach is one of my favorite places to vacation. I enjoy film and have an obsession with the works of Stanly Kubric. I am somewhat of a sports nut. I watch the Panthers and Hornets religiously, but my true passion is soccer.
